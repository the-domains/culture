Why everyone gets the Monty Hall problem wrong.

The problem is stated thus:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

****

The natural reaction is that it is wise to stay with your choice. The correct "mathematical" choice is to re-choose.

The reason we make such a choice is that when someone does something unexpected after we have made some action, is that they are trying to affect us (scare, put off balance). Why remove one AFTER we chose, other than to fuck with us? If the game was really meant to be a 'pick one out of two' then that's how it would have started

The logical thing is to ignore the action and stick with your choice. Especially assuming the host knows where the car is (which of course he must, because he opened the other door). On top of that, if you had picked the wrong one, why would he try to change you, to benefit you? (Why would the host prefer giving away something valuable). 

Games people play are rarely if ever based in math, and are more likely psychologically based strategy.
